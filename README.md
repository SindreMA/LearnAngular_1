# LearnAngular1

This is a project i made to learn some Angular.
To start off i've started with a simple application, a item level calculator.

This were one of my early c# apps. 
It lets you see change the item level of some slots too see if it will bump you to the next number.

This takes use of components, layout, router, props passing, state handling, api requests, UI libary usage, and more


A demo is hosted at https://angular.sindrema.com/
